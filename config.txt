|: Which Speech Recognition API do you like to test ? 
enter : (Google Discovery/Google Cloud) (Other choses upcoming) - default [Google Discovery] :| ***HERE***

|: If you are using Google Discovery, you could chose to make it returns alternatives guesses.
If you do, It will output few guesses and the Speech API Tester will chose the most accurate one. 
That would increase the recgnition accuracy but might make it a bit slower, but it's definitly 
not cheating ! and you might use this feature in your app. 

Do you want to use alternatives (Yes/No) ? - default [Yes] :| ***HERE***

|: If you are using Google Discovery, you could chose to input some hints to help it with the 
recognition, it this case, we are going to feeding it up with the playlist dataset as hints. 
Once again that is suppose to increase it's accuracy but might make it slower. 
You could juge it by yourself ;)
